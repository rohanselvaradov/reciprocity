# High level
- Generate a k-len binary sequence
- Select an index and communicate it securely with other party without the server knowing
- Set the bit at that position to the desired value
  - This needs to be done on the client side in a way such that the server doesn't know the bit that got changed
- Send to server, AND with other party's submission
  - Server can store the sequence as plaintext until the later party submits
- Receive back result, check the bit at the position

- There needs to be a sequence produced for each combination in the product of users and match options?

function getRandomBitstring(k) {
    RETURN a randomly generated binary array of length k 
}

const k = SOME_VALUE

bitstrings = {}
otherUsers.forEach(u => {
    options.forEach(o ={
        bitstrings[u][o] = getRandomBitstring(k)
    });
});
